Glioma is the most common primary brain tumour that forms in the brain parenchyma. It is diagnosed most frequently, accounting for 60% of all malignant neoplasms.

Symptoms:
- Headaches unresponsive to taking analgesics
- Double vision and decreased visual acuity.
- Menstrual disorders, infertility, galactorrhoea.
- Increased growth - gigantism in children and acromegaly in adults
- Weakness, lethargy, irritability, insomnia, body trembling

Treatment modalities:
Glioma involves a clear and systematic treatment, a thorough diagnosis should be carried out and only then a comprehensive therapy is prescribed. But until now the treatment of brain glioma by surgery is the main method, even if it has many contraindications. 
Such methods as radiation and chemotherapy cannot serve as a substitute for it, as there is an area in the centre of the glioma that is not well affected by radiation and chemopreventive agents
