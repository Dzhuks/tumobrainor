Pituitary Adenoma is a benign tumor that develops from the cells of the anterior pituitary gland. In many cases, it remains asymptomatic for decades and is discovered incidentally. However, in some individuals, it is accompanied by specific manifestations that significantly reduce the quality of life.

Symptoms:
- Headaches that do not respond to analgesics
- Double vision and decreased visual acuity
- Menstrual cycle irregularities, infertility, galactorrhea
- Increased growth – gigantism in children and acromegaly in adults
- Weakness, lethargy, irritability, insomnia, tremors

Treatment Methods:
- Conservative treatment – the use of medications to normalize elevated levels of specific hormones.
- Surgical treatment – removal of all tumor cells. This can be performed via a transcranial (through skull trepanation) or transnasal (through the nose) approach.
- Radiation therapy – a method of conservative treatment.
