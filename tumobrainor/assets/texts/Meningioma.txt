A meningioma is a tumour arising from the spinal or brain spider web (arachnoid) sheath. Malignant variants are not often diagnosed. Most tumours grow slowly and do not affect the nerve tissue itself, but only its surface.

Signs and symptoms:
- Disturbance of brain functioning: head spinning, gag reflex, poor memory and changes in psycho-emotional character.
- The localisation of the tumour affects the person's condition and is reflected in impaired movement of the limbs, impaired hearing and vision.

Methods of treatment:
- Conservative treatment. Irradiation of the tumour, after which the tumour cells are killed, which either reduces the likelihood of further development of the tumour or completely removes it.
- Radical therapy is performed in case of the strongest increase in the volume of the tumour or in case of malignant nature of the tumour.
- Surgical method. In some cases, it is possible to remove the fibres of the tumour, which will completely disarm it, but may adversely affect the quality of life of the patient.
